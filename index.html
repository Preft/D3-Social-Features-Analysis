          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>It appears that there is a moderate positive correllation between those in poverty and those who smoke, are obese, or lack healthcare.</p>
          <p>The age of a person seems to have no correlation with wether they smoke or are obese. However, there may be a logarithmically decreasing function that would moderately match with the lacking of healthcare and age. This could be because younger poeple are more likely to be healthy and hence have better opportunity for healthcare coverage, while an older person would be more likely to have health issues and thus face less healthcare options. </p>
          <p>Meadian household income appears to have a negative correlation to all three features. This is probably due to access of exspensive healthier food, less finacial stress which helps a person avoid smoking as a relief, and ability to buy healthcare plans which might be a luxary compared to other household expenses.</p>
